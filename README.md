## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Getting up and running

1. Install & set up FVM [https://pub.dev/packages/fvm] to get the correct flutter version for this project
2. Sentinal uses the Derry [https://pub.dev/packages/derry] script runner to quickly and easily run `build_runner` for any codegen as well as cleaning the project:

```
    build: fvm flutter build web --dart-define=FLAVOR=stage
    build-prod: fvm flutter build web --dart-define=FLAVOR=prod
    test: fvm flutter test
    clean: fvm flutter clean
    generate: dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    clean-generate: fvm flutter clean && fvm flutter pub get && dart run
    build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```


### Architecture

Sentinal Secure makes use of Clean Architecture (Here is a fantastic explainer on the general approach I had followed)[https://dev.to/marwamejri/flutter-clean-architecture-1-an-overview-project-structure-4bhf] as well as BLoC for state management. Ideally this project would have used FREEZED package but there were limitations with regard to inheritance, especially around how the model and entity are implemented, so had to use the Equatable package instead.

## Adding a new feature to Sentinal

Clean architecture forces quite deeply nested and duplicated folder structures for each feature you add to the app - so to make this simpler and less error-prone, this project was set up to use mason [https://pub.dev/packages/mason] I created a mason brick called `sentinal_feature` that when run, sets up the file structure for a new feature, allowing developers to just focus on solving the problem and not spending time setting up folders each time - this can be extended to also set up the folder sctructure in the test directory (I'd attempted this but ultimately took too long for this particular challenge)


This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```
